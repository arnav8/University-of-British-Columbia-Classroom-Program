Urban Big Data Analysis & Spatial Analysis Using Geographic Information Systems Classroom Summer Course

    • Urban Big Data Analysis:
This course helped me to harness the power of big data by mastering the way they are collected, organized, and analyzed to support better decision making in an urban planning context. I learnt the basic tools needed to manipulate large datasets derived from various open-data platforms, from data collection to storage and approaches to analysis. I developed the apposite skillset capture and build data structures, perform SQL, basic queries in order to extract key metrics and insights and the use of open-source programming tools, such as R and Python, to analyze and visualize the data. These statistical tools and methods were complemented by machine learning and pattern detection techniques, in addition to new technologies for big data.

    • Spatial Analysis Using Geographic Information Systems
GIS technology sits at the intersection of the world around us and the incredible computing capabilities that allow us to investigate and visualize that world in new and exciting ways. This course  introduced to the key concepts, methods, and tools used to collect, analyze, map, and visualize geospatial data. I used geospatial data to help with decision making and to inform policy-making. Practical applications were investigated in both the natural and human realms through lectures, discussions, group exercises, and a hands-on computer lab component.
